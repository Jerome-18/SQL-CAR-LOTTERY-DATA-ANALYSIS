###   CREATING THE TABLE IN SQL

To create the table in sql I used sql workbench and imported the csv file of the data by specifying the columns and column types rather than inserting the data
manually.


### ANALYSIS

I started by looking at each columns of the data. I have used the general functions, aggregate functions, aggregate functions with window functions , wildcards and case statements for writing the queries.
